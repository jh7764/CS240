For question 1, I used nested for loops to print a right-sided star triangle. As the number of rows increases, the number of spaces decreases but the number of stars increases by 1 for each row. For question 2, I also used nested for loops to print a hourglass-shaped star figure. To print the top part of the hourglass, almost like an upside down triangle. I looped through from n number of rows upward; as each row decreases so does the number of spaces but the number of stars increases. I then reversed this logic for the bottom half of the hourglass-shaped figure. For question 3, I printed the sum of the series x-x^3+x^5-x^7... for the inputed amount of terms and value for x. To get the sign to alternate, each odd term is multiplied by -1 to get the next term to be negative. Lastly, all the terms are added together to find the sum.
